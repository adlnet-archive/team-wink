###Purpose
This xAPI Design Cohort (Season 3) team set out to create/design an informal learning experience and use the Experience API to report the learning experience information between platforms in a corporate environment.

The resulting project focused on endowing SharePoint Web Parts with xAPI learning experience tracking capabilities. The proof of concept focused on tracking interactions with SharePoint documents, forums, videos and wikis.
