###Purpose
This [xAPI Design Cohort (Season 3)](http://www.adlnet.gov/from-adl-team-member-craig-wiggins-xapi-design-cohort-season-3-kickoff/index.html) team set out to create/design an informal learning experience and use the [Experience API](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-spec) to report the learning experience information between platforms in a corporate environment.

The resulting project focused on endowing [SharePoint](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SharePoint) Web Parts with xAPI learning experience tracking capabilities. The proof of concept focused on tracking interactions with SharePoint documents, forums, videos and wikis.
